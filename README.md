# nemo-file-browser-hack

This applies a simple hack to the nemo file browser to sort underscores first, as known from the Windows file explorer.

The Makefile automatically downloads, patches, builds and installs the hacked version of the nemo file browser on your system.

Tested in Ubuntu 20.04 (64-bit)
